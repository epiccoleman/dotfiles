# To Do

## On Initial Setup 
* Install ProFont 
* Update vim to latest
* install brew packages (brew bundle?)

## Todo
* Switch to Homeshick on Mac. Do I need to source homeshick.sh in ~/.zshrc? I'm not sure how this is currently working on linux.
* Break common shell code into its own file, sourced from .zshrc and .bashrc 
* How can I test this?  (serverspec in docker??)
* Packer image for Linux VM
* rbenv and install scripts
* tmux keybindings for window switching - once that's done, unbind p and use it to paste tmux buffer

## Misc
* tmux-resurrect and tmux-continuum
* need a way to distinguish between linux or osx (probably could just prompt in `first_time_setup`)
