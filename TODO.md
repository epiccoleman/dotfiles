# To Do

## On Initial Setup 
* Install ProFont 
* Update vim to latest
* install brew packages (brew bundle?)

## Misc
* Need a nice way to add the homesick gem to the path when using `gem: --user-install`
* can I change out this awful ass # in profont
* need a way to distinguish between linux or osx (probably could just prompt in `first_time_setup`) 
* homeshick is homesick without the ruby dependency and with a stupider name. it might be worth switching, look into it more

* tmux conf
* break out common shell stuff into its own file, which is sourced by .zshrc and .bashrc
* xsel

* nerdtree?? 

* already did the below on OSX, but would be good to find scriptable way to do it
