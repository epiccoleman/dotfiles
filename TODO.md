# To Do

## On Initial Setup 
* Install ProFont 
* Update vim to latest
* install brew packages

## Misc
* Need a nice way to add the homesick gem to the path when using `gem: --user-install`
* can I change out this awful ass # in profont
* need a way to distinguish between linux or osx (probably could just prompt in `first_time_setup`)
