on creating a new linux box, you'll need to install at least the following packages:

zsh
tmux
curl
vim-gtk
wget
tree
terminator
silversearcher-ag
emacs

keepass
firefox
spotify

`linux/install-apt-packages.sh` used to be an up to date way to do this, but sometimes you might want to build from source, so take it with a grain of salt.




also, need to set terminator as default term
set zsh as default shell
setup asdf

setup some kind of xfce theme probably too
